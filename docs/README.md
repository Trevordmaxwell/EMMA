# EMMA Documentation Map

This directory gathers design references, experiment reports, and onboarding material for new collaborators.

- **architecture.md** – high-level overview of the EMMA design and module responsibilities.
- **EMMA_Framework_Report.md / EMMA_AdaptiveMix_Report.md** – deep-dive reports covering training regimes and adaptive mixing studies.
- **audit_toolchain.md** – describes the evaluation tooling used to validate experiments.
- **progress.md** – rolling changelog of major research milestones.
- **roadmap.md** – prioritized backlog and open questions for upcoming research sprints.
- **diagrams/** – Graphviz and LaTeX sources for architecture figures.
- **trevor_maxwell.md** – personal notes and context that motivated the project scope.

Feel free to add new subfolders for future papers, presentations, or meeting notes. Keep heavyweight assets (videos, high-resolution renders) inside `EMMA_large_assets/` and link to them here if needed.
