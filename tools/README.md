# Tools

This directory collects small utilities and helper scripts that do not belong in the core package.

- Add reusable maintenance utilities here (e.g., log cleanup, report generation).
- Keep experiment-specific code under `notebooks/` or `experiments/` instead.

Feel free to add Python modules or shell scripts as needed; structure subfolders by theme if the directory grows.
